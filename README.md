# The Cookie Stand

## Salmon Cookies

The purpose of this project was to get some practice manipulating the dom, getting exposure to constructors in Javascript, and extensive practice in using loops.
I also used a but of humor in building out and styling in HTML and CSS.

### *Objectives

- V. 0.0.1
    Within the javascript file (example: app.js), create separate JS object literals for each shop location that outputs the following to the sales.html file:

  - Stores the min/max hourly customers, and the average cookies per customer, in object properties
  - Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random
  - Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated
  - Store the results for each location in a separate array… perhaps as a property of the object representing that location
  - Display the values of each

- V. 0.1.0
  - Replace all of object literals for the salmon cookie stand with a single constructor function that, when called with the ‘new’ keyword, it creates a new instance.

  - Replace the lists of data for each store and build a single table of data instead. It should look similar to the following:

  - Display each stores data in a table format similar to what is below. Break each column by the hour and complete each row with a “Daily Location Total”.

- V. 1.0.0
  - Finish Styling, Clean up, and Deploy!
